== Scope

This document defines requirements for encoding application schemas in UML, which conform to the UML profile defined by <<ref_iso19103>> and potentially also <<ref_iso19109>>, as JSON schemas. The requirements classes cover the creation of JSON schemas for:

* a plain JSON encoding;
* a GeoJSON-compliant encoding; and
* a JSON encoding compliant to JSON-FG 0.1

Additional requirements classes support encoding choices for unions, code list valued properties, property values given by reference, and entity types.
