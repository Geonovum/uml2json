== Abstract

This best practice document on UML to JSON encoding rules is an initiative of Geonovum. The aim is to come to a standardized encoding from UML to JSON, in order to achieve technical interoperability in the chain from conceptual models to JSON implementation. In this document, JSON implementation includes plain JSON, GeoJSON and JSON-FG.

Application schemas in UML are used to model geospatial information for a given domain, as part of data specifications defining information and data content of a relevant universe of discourse. In the geospatial domain, UML profiles are defined by <<ref_iso19103>> and <<ref_iso19109>>. These profiles are also used in this document. Application schemas operate at the conceptual level. At the implementation or data level, JSON is one of the major data encodings used by current web applications. The UML to JSON encoding rules defined in the context of this document is a best practice. Eventually, this document may also support the development of an international standard for the conversion of UML to JSON (Schema) in the geospatial domain.

To facilitate a proper JSON encoding, an extension of the ISO 19103 and 19109 UML profiles is proposed, resulting in a UML-JSON encoding profile.

The encoding rules are structured in 40 requirements and a number of recommendations, subdivided into 18 core requirements, 1 requirement specific for plain JSON schema format, 5 for GeoJSON format, 5 for JSON-FG Schema format, 3 requirements for binding and referencing of elements, 2 for union constructs, 5 for code lists and 1 for encoding a dedicated entity property in JSON. The requirement classes are supported by UML examples and subsequent JSON encodings.

== Preface

The project leading to this document was initiated by Geonovum. In collaboration with Interactive Instruments a best practice is developed on encoding UML to JSON. The project team consisted of the following persons:

* Clemens Portele (Interactive Instruments)
* Johannes Echterhoff (Interactive Instruments)
* Linda van den Brink (Geonovum)
* Paul Janssen (Geonovum)
* Pieter Bresters (Geonovum)
* Wilko Quak (Geonovum).

This document defines how a conceptual schema in UML, compliant to <<ref_iso19103>> and <<ref_iso19109>>, can be encoded in JSON. A number of requirements classes are defined, which contain the necessary requirements and technical details.

JSON is one of the major data encodings used by current web applications. In order to achieve a high level of interoperability when exchanging JSON encoded data between such applications, especially when the applications are developed by different entities, the semantics and structure of the data need to be well defined. In the geospatial domain, conceptual schemas are used to define application relevant information. Typically, some additional schema language is used to define the structures for encoding the information. For JSON encoded data, such a schema language is JSON Schema. Ideally, the JSON Schema constructs can automatically be derived from a conceptual schema. For that task, a set of encoding rules is needed. 

Within the OGC, the https://www.ogc.org/projects/initiatives/ugas-2020[UML-to-GML Application Schema Pilot 2020] (UGAS-2020) was the first innovation initiative that produced a comprehensive set of encoding rules, for the conversion of ISO 19109 compliant application schemas in UML to JSON Schema. The <<ref_ugas2020,UGAS-2020 Engineering Report>> documents the findings of that initiative.

This document is based on and extends the results of UGAS-2020 regarding JSON Schema encoding rules. It defines the conversion behavior in an implementation agnostic way, adhering to the requirements defined in <<ref_modspec>> for writing OGC standards. This document thus represents the next step on the way to standardizing JSON Schema encoding rules in the geospatial domain.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.
