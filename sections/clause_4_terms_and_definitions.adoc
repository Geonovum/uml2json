=== Terms and definitions

==== linked data

Linked data is the data format that supports the Semantic Web. The basic rules for linked data are defined as:

 * Use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify things;
 * Use HTTP URIs so that these things can be referred to and looked up ("dereferenced") by people and user agents;
 * Provide useful information about the thing when its URI is dereferenced, using standard formats such as RDF/XML; and
 * Include links to other, related URIs in the exposed data to improve discovery of other related information on the Web.

==== feature type

A feature type as defined by the General Feature Model (see <<ref_iso19109>>). In an application schema, a feature type is typically modeled using stereotype \<<featureType>>, or a stereotype that maps to that stereotype.

==== object type

An object type is a standard class, instances are plain objects with identity. An object type is not a feature type. In an application schema, an object type has no stereotype, or has stereotype \<<type>>, or has a stereotype that maps to one of these two options.

==== data type

As defined by <<ref_iso19103>>, section 6.10, a data type is a class with stereotype \<<dataType>> (or a stereotype that maps to that stereotype), which is a set of properties that lacks identity.

Note to self for future documents: You can find acronyms by generating the document as HTML, saving it as XHTML, and then running the following XQuery (for example in the oXygen XML editor, on the opened XHTML document):

let $acronyms :=
  for $text in //*[not(local-name() = ('script','style'))]/text()[fn:string-length() > 0]
  let $tokens := fn:tokenize($text,'\W')
  return
    for $token in $tokens
    return
    if(matches($token,'^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+')) then $token else ()

return sort(distinct-values($acronyms))


You'll have to throw away false-positives but in general this has been useful.
