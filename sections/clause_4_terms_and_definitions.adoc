=== Terms and definitions

==== linked data

Linked data is the data format that supports the Semantic Web. The basic rules for linked data are defined as:

 * Use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify things;
 * Use HTTP URIs so that these things can be referred to and looked up ("dereferenced") by people and user agents;
 * Provide useful information about the thing when its URI is dereferenced, using standard formats such as RDF/XML; and
 * Include links to other, related URIs in the exposed data to improve discovery of other related information on the Web.

==== feature type

A feature type as defined by the General Feature Model (see <<ref_iso19109>>). In an application schema, a feature type is typically modeled using stereotype \<<featureType>>, or a stereotype that maps to that stereotype.

==== object type

An object type is a standard class, instances are plain objects with identity. An object type is not a feature type. In an application schema, an object type has no stereotype, or has stereotype \<<type>>, or has a stereotype that maps to one of these two options.

==== data type

As defined by <<ref_iso19103>>, section 6.10, a data type is a class with stereotype \<<dataType>> (or a stereotype that maps to that stereotype), which is a set of properties that lacks identity.

/////

Note to self for future documents: You can find acronyms by generating the document as HTML, saving it as XHTML, and then running the following XQuery:

let $acronyms :=
  for $text in //text()[fn:string-length() > 0]
  let $tokens := fn:tokenize($text,'\W')
  return
    for $token in $tokens
    return
    if(matches($token,'^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+')) then $token else ()

return sort(distinct-values($acronyms))


You'll have to throw away a couple of false-positives but in general this has been useful.
