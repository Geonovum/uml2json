Brief minutes of meeting 20221117:

att: Johannnes, Clemens, Wilko, Pieter, Paul, Linda

No minustes are made as the decissions taken are included as notes in the working doc.

One specific point needs attention from the Geonovum side.

About the [Identifier](https://geonovum.github.io/uml2json/document.html#toc37)

It is stated now that a feature type can have only one property with the IsID = true tag and that it needs to be a simple type.

In NEN 3610 (Dutch base standard for geo-information) we have two properties that contain the id information. One named, identification and one named domain. This is a flattened version of the former NEN3610id complex data type. It is a conceptual id. Each technical implementation can define its own mapping to an operational id. However in the data transfer both the conceptual as well as the operational id are exchanged.

Question is if this works with this requirement class?
