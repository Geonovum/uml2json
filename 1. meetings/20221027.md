Brief minutes of meeting 20221027:

att: Johannnes, Clemens, Wilko, Pieter, Paul

General

*	Proposal from Interactive Instruments has a fixed price construct; the Geonovum assignment is based on recorded cost. Check what Geonovum’s intentions are.

Content and process:

*	Github repository is created: https://github.com/Geonovum/uml2json
    *	This will be our working Git
    *	Johannes will transfer the working files/doc (DONE)
*	The OGC format is used for the working doc.
    * In the Notice a text will be included that this is a working doc developed and maintained by Geonovum and that it potentially will be put forward into the OGC process
    * DONE - added to the Preface section; looks like the document header (from Notice to License Agreement) is auto-generated by metanorma, so we cannot change that content
*	The content of the (UGAS) Engineering report is now put into the format as the starting text
*	Requirement classes will be defined as is done in the OGC format, conformance classes probably not needed or to be decided
*	Work ahead is:
    * filtering the shapechange references
    * Review / analyze the impact of different JSON schema versions, then joint decision on target JSON Schema version
    * add JSON-FG encoding rule
    * define requirements and conformance classes for UML to JSON Schema encoding rules
*	A structure on how to structure addressing the different JSON types needs to be developed. It has to be inline with the OGC way of structuring such a matter
    * Idea: Have an annex with application schema example, and resulting JSON Schema as well as example JSON instances for all three encoding rules
        * only if there is time at the end of this phase; could also be moved to the next project phase
    * Another idea for document re-structuring, so that the requirements classes are more clearly defined and reflected in the document structure:
        * Revise so that parts that are common to all encoding rules comes first (and can then be an abstract core requirements class)
        * Then each encoding rule can have ist own section, with specific requirements documented there (requirements classes that extend the core requirements class)
*	Examples of JSON encodings were presented. Interesting discussion on the label ‘entityType’
*	Next meeting in two weeks (10th of November, 2022)
