A «union» shall be encoded as a JSON Schema definition that represents a choice between the value types of the union properties.

* If the value types are only simple, without a specific format definition or other restrictions defined by JSON Schema keywords, then the JSON Schema shall only contain a "type" member, with an array of the simple types.
* Otherwise, a "oneOf" member shall be added to the JSON Schema definition, with:
** one "$ref" per non-simple type,
** one "type" for all simple types without specific keywords, and
** one "type" per simple type with specific keywords.
