statement:: Definitions schemas should not be published under media type application/json. Instead, a JSON Schema should be published with media type application/schema+json - which is defined by the JSON Schema specification. The media type application/schema+json supports JSON Pointers and plain names as fragment identifiers. For further details, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-02#section-5[JSON Schema core, chapter 5].
