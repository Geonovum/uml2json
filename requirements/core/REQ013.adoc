[.component,class=part]
--
If the multiplicity lower bound of a UML property is 1 or greater, and the class that owns the property is not a «union», then the property shall be listed under the "required" properties of the JSON object to which the property belongs.

[.component,class=part]

In addition, if the multiplicity upper  bound of the property is greater than 1, then the JSON Schema definition for the property shall be created as follows.

* The "type" of the JSON property is set to "array", with the "items" keyword containing the JSON Schema constraints that are created to represent the value type of the property.
* If the multiplicity lower bound is greater than 0, it is encoded using the "minItems" keyword.
* If the multiplicity upper  bound is not unbounded, it is encoded using the "maxItems" keyword.
* If the values of the property are defined to be unique (which is the default for UML properties), then that is represented by adding `"uniqueItems": true`.
