statement:: The value type of a UML property shall be encoded as a JSON Schema constraint, as follows:
part:: If the value type of a UML property is an external type, and the JSON Schema definition of that external type is a simple JSON value type, i.e., "string", "number", "integer", or "boolean", then a "type" key shall be added to the JSON Schema definition of the property, with the simple JSON value type as value;
part:: Otherwise, a "$ref" key shall be added to the JSON Schema that constrains the property. The "$ref" value shall be a reference to the JSON Schema definition of the value type, within a particular definitions schema. The reference can be absolute or relative, and typically contains a fragment identifier to identify the definition of the value type.
