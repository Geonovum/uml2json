identifier:: http://www.opengis.net/spec/uml2json/1.0/req/core/format-and-pattern
statement:: Whenever an external type is implemented by a simple JSON Schema type with specific "format", it is recommended that the type definition be accompanied by a "pattern" member, whose value should contain a regular expression that is sufficient to represent the intended format.

<<table_req_core_iso19103_patterns>> provides a list of regular expressions for a number of types from <<ref_iso19103>>. If the "pattern" keyword is used, these expressions should be used. However, applications may also use different regular expressions. For example, a community may choose to only allow date time values in Zulu time (i.e., requiring the time zone designator to always be 'Z').
