In the JSON Schema definition of a feature type, the primary geometry property (identified following the rules in <<jsonschema_req_core_primary_geometry>>) shall be encoded as a type restriction for the top-level "geometry" member. If the primary geometry property is optional, then the schema restriction for the "geometry" member shall define a choice - using the "oneOf" JSON Schema keyword - between a null value and the geometry schema definition for the value type of the geometry property. The primary geometry property shall not be encoded within the "properties" member.
