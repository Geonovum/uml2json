A UML property that is owned by a «FeatureType» and that has tag "jsonPrimaryInstant" with value equal to, ignoring case, "true", shall not be encoded within the "properties" member. Instead, it shall be encoded as a type restriction for the top-level "time" member. The additional restriction for the "time" member shall be encoded using "$ref" with value "https://register.geostandaarden.nl/jsonschema/uml2json/0.1/schema_definitions.json#/$defs/PrimaryInstantOptional", if the minimum multiplicity of the property is 0, otherwise "https://register.geostandaarden.nl/jsonschema/uml2json/0.1/schema_definitions.json#/$defs/PrimaryInstantRequired".
