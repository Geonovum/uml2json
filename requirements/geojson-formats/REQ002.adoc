statement:: A UML property of a feature type, wich is modeled with "isId" = true, shall be mapped to the "id" member of a GeoJSON feature. The mapping algorithm is community specific - especially if multiple such properties exist in a feature type. However, if at least one such property is present in a feature type, then the top-level "id" member of GeoJSON features that encode instances of the feature type shall have a value.
